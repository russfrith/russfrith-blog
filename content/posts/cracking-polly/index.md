## Introduction
Polly is a resilience and transient-fault-handling library that provides developers with an easy and effective way to handle and recover from faults in their applications.

One of the key features of Polly is its ability to automatically retry failed operations. This means that if an operation fails, Polly will automatically retry it, without you having to write any additional code. This can greatly improve the reliability and availability of your applications, and reduce the amount of time and effort you need to spend on fault handling and recovery.

Polly also offers a wide range of customization options. You can customize the way in which retries are performed, and even create your own custom policies if you need to. This means that you can tailor the retry behavior to suit your specific needs, and ensure that your applications are as resilient as possible.

If you are looking for a simple and effective way to handle and recover from faults in your applications, then .NET Polly is definitely worth considering. It is a powerful tool that offers a wide range of customization options, and can greatly improve the reliability and availability of your applications.
