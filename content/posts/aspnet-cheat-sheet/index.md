Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

A View is a visual representation of a Model, retrieving data from the Model to display to the user and passing requests back and forth between the user and the Model. A Controller is an organizational part of the user interface that lays out and coordinates multiple Views on the screen, and which receives user input and sends the appropriate messages to its underlying Views.
